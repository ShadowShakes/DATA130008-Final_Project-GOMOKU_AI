This project is the final project of class "Artificial Intelligence" in School of Data Science, Fudan University (2020 Autumn). It is designed to play a GOMOKU game automatically.
The project is finished by Shaohan Chen and Yuanzhu Zhan, with some reference from other GOMOKU projects but independent analysis by ourselves.
The final competing version of our GOMOKU AI reached 1230 points on ranking list.

GOMOKU_AI is our final AI based on a revised version of alpha_beta pruning.
MCTS_AI is the implementation of MCTS algorithm.

To compete in the rating rank, do "pyinstaller GOMOKU_AI.py pisqpipe.py --name pbrain-XXX.exe --onefile".
To test MCTS, do "pyinstaller MCTS_AI.py pisqpipe.py --name pbrain-XXX.exe --onefile".

pbrain-final_version.exe is the exe of our final competing version of AI.
pbrain-MCTS_version.exe is the exe of our MCTS version of AI.
